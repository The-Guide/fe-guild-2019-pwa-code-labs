                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    <code>YOU NEED A NATIVE APP</code>. That's what we've been told repeatedly since Apple first
                    announced the iPhone App Store. And perhaps you do. Native apps can make sense depending on an
                    organization's size and needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But what about potential customers who don't have your app? Or current customers on a desktop
                    computer? What about people with limited space on their phones who delete apps to make room for
                    other things? What is their experience like?
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where <em>progressive web apps</em> (sometimes referred to as PWAs) shine. They combine the
                    best features of the web with capabilities previously only available to native apps. Progressive web
                    apps can be launched from an icon on the homescreen or in response to a push notification. They load
                    nearly instantaneously and can be built to work offline.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Best of all, progressive web apps simply work. They are an enhancement to your website. No one needs
                    to install anything to use a progressive web app. The first time someone visits your website, the
                    features of a progressive web app are available immediately. No app stores (unless you want them).
                    No gatekeepers. No barriers.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    <strong>What You'll Learn</strong>
                </h2>

                <p>
                    This workshop is built around different technologies that when put togheter help create a
                    Progressive
                    Web Application
                </p>

                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li>Web App Manifest</li>
                    <li>Service Worker</li>
                    <li>Background Synchronization</li>
                    <li>Web Push Notifications</li>
                    <li>Accessing the native device capabilities</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Progressive web apps represent much more than the discrete technologies that comprise them. They
                    herald a new era where fast and immersive experiences are democratized. Itâ€™s not surprising
                    that some of the earliest adopters of progressive web apps have been in developing markets where
                    storage is limited, connections are slow, and networks are metered.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    <strong>What you'll need</strong>
                </h2>

                <p>Basic understanding of the following topics</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6/ECMAScript2015+)</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Promises</li>
                    <li>Fetch API</li>
                    <li>Indexed DB</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    While the first topic is a hard requirement for the rest there are some introductory code labs
                    present.
                </p>
