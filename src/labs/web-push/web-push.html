Communication channels such as social media, emails, and in-app notifications are great, but they don’t always grab the attention of the user, especially when the user navigates away from the website.</p><p>This is where push notifications come in. They’re those helpful notifications that appear on your device that prompt you about information that could be useful to you. You can swipe or tap away to close them, or you can tap them and be instantly directed to a web page with the relevant information. Traditionally, only native applications had this amazing ability to tap into the operating system of a device and send push notifications. This is where PWAs are a game changer. They have the ability to receive push notifications that appear in the browser.</p><p>The best thing about push notifications is that the user receives them even when they aren't browsing your site. The experience looks and feels like a native app and works even if the browser isn't running. This makes it a perfect way to engage with users and draw them back to your web app even if they haven't opened the browser in a while. For example, if your website is a weather application, a push notification could provide your users with useful information such as warnings about approaching bad weather. You could even schedule weekly weather forecasts that can be sent as a push notification, depending on how your users subscribe. The possibilities are endless.</p><p>But what about malicious websites using this technology to send spammy push notifications? In order to send push messages to a user, the user first needs to opt in to your messages.Once a user has either accepted or blocked the push notification prompt, the prompt won't appear again. It's important to note that that this prompt will only appear if the site is running over HTTPS, has a registered Service Worker, and you have written code for it.</p><h2><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></h2><ul class="checklist"><li>Subscribing to notifications</li><li>VAPID protocol</li><li>Sending notifications</li><li>Receiving and interacting with notifications</li><li>Unsubscribe from notifications</li></ul><h2><strong>What you'll need</strong></h2><ul><li>Chrome 67, Edge 17, Firefox 61, Opera 44 or above</li><li>Your favorite text editor</li><li>Basic knowledge of HTML and JSON</li></ul></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Getting set up" duration="3"><h2>Project Set Up</h2><p>In this code lab we are building on top of the project started in the <code>Keeping your data synchronized with BackgroundSync API</code> code lab.</p><p>If you didn't do it already: <strong>Fork</strong> and then <strong>Clone</strong> the following repository: <code>https://github.com/The-Guide/fe-guild-2019-pwa.git</code></p><pre><code>

If they accept, you can save their subscription details on the server and use them to send notifications later. These subscription details are unique to each user, device, and browser, so if a user logs in to your site on multiple devices, they'll be prompted once per device.</p><p>Once they've accepted, you can use these stored subscription details to send messages to a user later with a scheduled task that updates users with timely information.</p><p>Before you can start sending notifications to a user, you need to ask their permission by displaying a prompt. This prompt functionality is built into the browser by default, but first you need to add a little code to ensure that this prompt is initiated. If a user accepts the prompt, you'll be provided with a subscription object containing information about their subscription. But if a user denies the prompt, you won't be able to send them any messages, and they won't be prompted again. This ensures that you aren't able to annoyingly prompt users every time they visit your site.</p><h2>User permissions</h2><p>In <code>app.js</code></p><pre><code>
const enableNotificationsButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.enable-notifications');

const askForNotificationPermission = () =&gt; {
    Notification.requestPermission(result=&gt; {

        enableNotificationsButtons[i].style.display = 'inline-block';
        enableNotificationsButtons[i].addEventListener('click', askForNotificationPermission);
    }
}
</code></pre><h3>Explanation</h3><p>We ask the user for permission when clicking any of the <code>Enable Notifications</code> buttons. The buttons should be visible only if the browser supports notifications.</p><p>Also in <code>app.css</code></p><pre><code>
.enable-notifications {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Displaying a Notification" duration="9"><p>Instead of logging to the console let's show a notification to the user when we receive permissions</p><p>In <code>app.js</code></p><pre><code>

</code></pre><h3>Notifications options</h3><p>Notifications can be sent from the <code>Service Worker</code> registraton and can receive an <code>options</code> object that can control both the <code>visual</code> and <code>behavioral</code> aspect of the notification.</p><p>In <code>app.js</code></p><pre><code>

There are also options that alter the behaviour of notifications.</p><p>By default, calling <code>showNotification()</code> with just visual options will have the following behaviours:</p><ul><li>Clicking on the notification does nothing.</li><li>Each new notification is shown one after the other. The browser will not collapse the notifications in any way.</li><li>The platform may play a sound or vibrate the user's devices (depending on the platform).</li><li>On some platforms the notification will disappear after a short period of time while others will show the notification unless the user interacts with it. (For example, compare your notifications on Android and Desktop.)</li></ul><p>In this step we are going to look at how we can alter these default behaviours using options alone. These are relatively easy to implement and take advantage of.</p><h3>Notification Click Event</h3><p>When a user clicks on a notification the default behaviour is for nothing to happen. It doesn't even close or remove the notification.</p><p>The common practice for a notification click is for it to close and perform some other logic (i.e. open a window or make some API call to the application).</p><p>To achieve this we need to add a <code>notificationclick</code> event listener to our service worker. This will be called when ever a notification is clicked.</p><p>In <code>sw-template.js</code></p><pre><code>
self.addEventListener('notificationclick', event =&gt; {
    const notification = event.notification;
    const action = event.action;

    console.log(notification);

    if (action === 'confirm') {
        console.log('Confirm was chosen');
        notification.close();
    } else {
        console.log(action);
        notification.close();
    }
});

self.addEventListener('notificationclose', event =&gt; console.log('Notification was closed', event));
</code></pre></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Subscribing to notifications" duration="10"><p>Subscribing a user requires two things. First, getting permission (<strong>DONE</strong>) from the user to send them push messages. Second, getting a PushSubscription from the browser.</p><p>A <code>PushSubscription</code> contains all the information we need to send a push message to that user. You can "kind of" think of this as an ID for that user's device.</p><p>This is all done in JavaScript with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API">Push API</a>.</p><p>Before subscribing a user you'll need to generate a set of "application server keys", which we'll cover later on.</p><p>The application server keys, also known as VAPID keys, are unique to your server. They allow a push service to know which application server subscribed a user and ensure that it's the same server triggering the push messages to that user.</p><p>Once we have our service worker registered and we've got permission, we can subscribe a user by calling <code>registration.pushManager.subscribe()</code>.</p><p>Once you've subscribed the user and have a PushSubscription, you'll need to send the PushSubscription details to your backend / server. On your server, you'll save this subscription to a database and use it to send a push message to that user.</p><p>In <code>app.js</code> just above <code>askForNotificationPermission</code>:</p><pre><code>
const configurePushSubscription = () =&gt; {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        let serviceWorkerRegistration;
        navigator.serviceWorker.ready
            .then(registration =&gt; {
                serviceWorkerRegistration = registration;
                return registration.pushManager.getSubscription();
            })
            .then(subscription =&gt; {
                if (subscription === null) {
                    // Create a new subscription
                    return serviceWorkerRegistration.pushManager.subscribe({
                        userVisibleOnly: true,
                        applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array('PUBLIC KEY HERE')
                    });
            })

            });
    }

const urlBase64ToUint8Array = base64String =&gt; {
    const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);

        outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return outputArray;
};
</code></pre><p>You may notice code we’ve used frequently throughout this code lab. You register the Service Worker and, if it’s successful, you can then use the registration object</p><p>We first check if you have a subscription by calling <code>registration.pushManager.getSubscription()</code> and if it is <code>null</code> we then call <code>subscribe()</code></p><p>When calling the <code>subscribe()</code> method, we pass in an <em>options</em> object, which consists of both required and optional parameters.</p><p>Lets look at all the options we can pass in.</p><h3>userVisibleOnly</h3><p>At the moment you <strong>must</strong> pass in a value of <code>true</code> in order to prevent the sending of a push message without showing a notification. This is commonly referred to as silent push, due to the user not knowing that something had happened in the background.</p><p>The concern was that developers could do nasty things like track a user's location on an ongoing basis without the user knowing.</p><h3>applicationServerKey</h3><p>We briefly mentioned "application server keys" in the previous section. "Application server keys" are used by a push service to identify the application subscribing a user and ensure that the same application is messaging that user.</p><p>Application server keys are a public and private key pair that are unique to your application. The private key should be kept a secret to your application and the public key can be shared freely.</p><p>The <code>applicationServerKey</code> option passed into the subscribe() call is the application's public key. The browser passes this onto a push service when subscribing the user, meaning the push service can tie your application's public key to the user's <code>PushSubscription</code>.</p><p>When you later want to send a push message, you'll need to create an <strong>Authorization</strong> header which will contain information signed with your application server's <strong>private key</strong>. When the push service receives a request to send a push message, it can validate this signed <strong>Authorization</strong> header by looking up the public key linked to the endpoint receiving the request. If the signature is valid the push service knows that it must have come from the application server with the <strong>matching private key</strong>. It's basically a security measure that prevents anyone else sending messages to an application's users.</p><p>The specification that defines what the application server key should be is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid">VAPID spec</a>. Whenever you read something referring to "application server keys" or "VAPID keys", just remember that they are the same thing.</p><h2>How to Create Application Server Keys</h2><p>You can create a public and private set of application server keys from the <code>fe-guild-2019-pwa-server</code> root folder by running <code>npm run web-push</code>. This uses the <a href="https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push#command-line">web-push command line</a> to generate keys.</p><p>After generating the keys make sure you replace the values inside the <code>configurePushSubscription</code> function in <code>app.js</code>. Also on the server side inside the <code>routes.js</code> file</p><h2>What is a PushSubscription?</h2><p>The <code>PushSubscription</code> object contains all the required information needed to send a push messages to that user. If you print out the contents using <code>JSON.stringify()</code>, you'll see the following:</p><pre><code>
{
    'endpoint': 'https://SOME.PUSHSERVICE.COM/SOMETHING-UNIQUE',
    'expirationTime': null,
    'keys': {
        'p256dh': 'BGhFV5qx5cdOaD_XF293OqMdYSUIrMrzj2-RuzGwOTIhdW8vFm_zN2VtwMOq9PRlyjaJ3uWjHVcM6ZWW8uXdKj8',
        'auth': 'HA1JEiRAp2HLuVH639Oumw'
    }
};
</code></pre><p>The <code>endpoint</code> is the push services URL. To trigger a push message, make a POST request to this URL.</p><p>The <code>keys</code> object contains the values used to encrypt message data sent with a push message (which we'll discuss later on in this step).</p><h2>Send a Subscription to the Server</h2><p>Once you have a push subscription you'll want to send it to your server. It's up to you how you do that but a tiny tip is to use JSON.stringify() to get all the necessary data out of the subscription object.</p><p>Adapt the <code>configurePushSubscription</code> function</p><pre><code>
const configurePushSubscription = () =&gt; {

For example, you could add a simple button to your web page that would allow users to unsubscribe at the tap of a button instead of digging around in their browser settings. The code in the following listing shows this in action.</p><pre><code>
const unsubscribe = () =&gt; {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker.ready
            .then(serviceWorkerRegistration =&gt; {
                return serviceWorkerRegistration.pushManager.getSubscription();
            })
            .then(subscription =&gt; {
                if (!subscription) {
                    console.log("Not subscribed, nothing to do.");
                    return;
                }
                return subscription.unsubscribe();
            })
            .then(() =&gt; console.log("Successfully unsubscribed!.")
            .catch(error =&gt; console.error('Error thrown while trying to unsubscribe from push messaging', error));
    }
};
</code></pre><p>The code in the listing above is a basic example that shows how you can unsubscribe a user. The listing contains code that will first check to see if the user is already subscribed using the <code>pushManager.getSubscription()</code> function. If the user is subscribed, you then unsubscribe them using the <code>subscription.unsubscribe()</code> function.</p><h2>Exercises</h2><ol><li>Implement the <code>unsubscribe</code> functionality.</li><li>Delete the subscription from the server as well.</li></ol></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Third-party push notifications" duration="1"><p>As you can imagine, the business of sending push notifications to the many different browsers out there can be tricky. If you’d prefer not to build your own push notification server and instead use a SaaS product, there are many third-party solutions out there.</p><p>Services such as OneSignal, Roost, and Aimtell all offer a solution that can target multiple browsers and provide you with enhanced functionality. Many of these services have created libraries to deal with all the major browsers, which means you’ll get full coverage and engagement regardless of browser. These services also have a lot of functionality built into them that allows you to schedule messages for a later date, and some have complex reporting charts that give insight into how your users are interacting with your notifications.</p></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Summary" duration="1"><p>Push notifications are a great way to engage with your users even after they navigate away from your site and close their browser window.</p><p>In order to send push messages to a user, they first need to opt in. This provides the developer with unique subscription details based on the user’s device and browser.</p><p>Once the user has opted in, it is important to save their subscription details in order to send messages to them.</p><p>VAPID is a specification that defines a handshake between your app server and the push service and allows the push service to confirm which site is sending messages.</p><p>Push notifications can be enhanced by using notification actions and even device vibration.</p><p>If you’d like to reach a wide range of browsers, some third-party services can deal with this.</p><h2><strong>What we've learned</strong></h2><p>Here is a checklist which breaks down the things we learned in this code lab.</p><ul class="checklist"><li>Subscribing to notifications</li><li>VAPID protocol</li><li>Sending notifications</li><li>Receiving and interacting with notifications</li><li>Unsubscribe from notifications</li></ul><h2>Resources</h2><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/">Web Push Notifications</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push">web-push package</a></li><li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid-02">VAPID spec</a></li><h3>Source code</h3><pre><code>$ git checkout pwa-web-push-final</code></pre></google-codelab-step></google-codelab></template><script>Polymer({is:"codelab-web-push",_twoWayBinding:function _twoWayBinding(value){return"{{"+value+"}}"},_oneWayBinding:function _oneWayBinding(value){return"[["+value+"]]"}});</script></dom-module></body></html>
