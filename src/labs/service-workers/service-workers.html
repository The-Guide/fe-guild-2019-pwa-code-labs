                <h2>
                    <strong>What is a service worker</strong>
                </h2>

                <p>
                    A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page,
                    opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already
                    include features like push notifications and background sync. In the future, service workers might
                    support other things like periodic sync or geofencing. The core feature discussed in this code lab
                    is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache
                    of responses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving
                    developers complete control over the experience.
                </p>

                <h2>The service worker life cycle</h2>

                <p>
                    A service worker has a lifecycle that is completely separate from your web page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With service workers, the following steps are generally observed for basic set up:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To install a service worker for your site, you need to register it, which you do in your page's
                        JavaScript. Registering a service worker will cause the browser to start the service worker
                        install step in the background.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next is activation. When the service worker is installed, it then receives an activate event.
                        The primary use of onactivate is for cleanup of resources used in previous versions of a Service
                        worker script.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Service worker will now control pages, but only those opened after the
                        <code>register()</code> is successful. i.e. a document starts life with or without a Service
                        worker and maintains that for its lifetime. So documents will have to be reloaded to actually
                        be controlled.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="[[rootPath]]images/labs/service-workers/sw-lifecycle.png">
                </p>

                <h2>Register a Service Worker</h2>

                <p>
                    To install a service worker you need to kick start the process by registering it in your page. This
                    tells the browser where your service worker JavaScript file lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Create a file named <code>sw.js</code> on the same level as <code>index.html</code> then in
                    <code>src/js/app.js</code>:
                </p>

                <pre>
<code>
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    ...
    // After the existing code
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker.register(`${baseUrl}sw.js`)
            .then( registration => {
            // Registration was successful
            console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            // registration failed :(
            console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err);
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This code checks to see if the service worker API is available, and if it is, the service worker at
                    <code>[baseUrl]/sw.js</code> is registered once the page is loaded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can call <code>register()</code> every time a page loads without concern; the browser will
                    figure out if the service worker is already registered or not and handle it accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One subtlety with the <code>register()</code> method is the location of the service worker file.
                    In this case that the service worker file is at the root of the domain. This means that the service
                    worker's scope will be the entire origin. In other words, this service worker will receive fetch
                    events for everything on this domain. If we register the service worker file at
                    <code>/src/js/sw.js</code>, then the service worker would only see fetch events for pages whose URL
                    starts with <code>/src/js/</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now you can check that a service worker is enabled by opening the Chrome Develoer Tools and then
                    <code>Application -> Service Workers</code>
                </p>

                <p style="display:flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                    <img src="[[rootPath]]images/labs/service-workers/dev-tools.png">
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may find it useful to test your service worker in an Incognito window so that you can close and
                    reopen knowing that the previous service worker won't affect the new window. Any registrations and
                    caches created from within an Incognito window will be cleared out once that window is closed.
                </p>

                <h2>Why is my service worker failing to register?</h2>

                <p>
                    This could be for the following reasons:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You are not running your application through HTTPS. During development you'll be able to use
                        service worker through <code>localhost</code>, but to deploy it on a site you'll need to have
                        HTTPS setup on your server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The path to your service worker file is not written correctly — it needs to be written relative
                        to the origin, not your app’s root directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The service worker being pointed to is on a different origin to that of your app. This is also
                        not allowed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let's listen to the main lifecycle events <code>install</code> and <code>activate</code></p>

<code>
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
    console.log('[Service Worker] Installing Service Worker ...', event);

    return self.clients.claim();
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    In the <code>install</code> callback is calling the <code>skipWaiting()</code> function to
                    trigger the <code>activate</code> event and tell the Service Worker to start working immediately
                    without waiting for the user to navigate or reload the page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <code>skipWaiting()</code> function forces the waiting Service Worker to become the active
                    Service Worker. The <code>self.skipWaiting()</code> function can also be used with the <code>self
                    .clients.claim()</code> function to ensure that updates to the underlying Service Worker
                    take effect immediately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code in the next listing can be combined with the <code>skipWaiting()</code> function in
                    order to ensure that your Service Worker activates itself immediately.

                <p>
                    Chrome handles most of the heavy lifting for you:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On mobile, Chrome will generate a WebAPK, creating an even more integrated experience for your
                        users.
                    </li>
                    <li>On desktop, your app will installed, and run in an app window.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What are the criteria?</h2>

                <p>
                    In order for a user to be able to install your Progressive Web App, it needs to meet the following
                    criteria:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The web app is not already installed</li>
                    <li>
                        Meets a user engagement heuristic (currently, the user has interacted with the domain for at
                        least 30 seconds)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Includes a web app manifest that includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>short_name</code> or <code>name</code></li>
                            <li><code>icons</code> must include a 192px and a 512px sized icons</li>
                            <li><code>start_url</code></li>
                            <li>
                                <code>display</code> must be one of: <code>fullscreen</code>, <code>standalone</code>,
                                or <code>minimal-ui</code>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Served over HTTPS (required for service workers)</li>
                    <li>
                        Has registered a service worker with a <code>fetch</code> event handler
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When these criteria are met, Chrome will fire a <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event that you can
                    use to prompt the user to install your Progressive Web App.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We meet all the criteria above, but one: we don't have a <code>fetch</code> event handler. Let's fix
                    that
                </p>

                <pre>
<code>
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    console.log('[Service Worker] Fetching something ....', event);

    // This fixes a weird bug in Chrome when you open the Developer Tools
    if (event.request.cache === 'only-if-cached' && event.request.mode !== 'same-origin') {
        return;
    }

    event.respondWith(fetch(event.request));
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    In Chrome click the Customize button and select <code>Install Progressive Selfies...</code>
                </p>

                <h2>App Install Banner</h2>

                <aside class="note">
                    <p>
                        The <strong>App Install Banner</strong> will show up only on Chrome on Android but we really
                        need to serve the app over HTTPS. In theory it could work on <code>localhost</code> with an
                        Android device connected via USB cable but I didn't manage to make it work.
                    </p>
                </aside>

                <p>
                    The easiest way is to have the app served over <code>HTTPS</code> is to publish it to <code>GitHub
                    Pages</code> but in order to do that there are several changes needed:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Hosting our site to <code>GitHub Pages</code> will place it under the following URL:
                            <code>https://[YOUR GITHUB PROFILE].github.io/fe-guild-2019-pwa/</code> (assuming that you
                            didn't change the repository name when forking). This means that our <code>base</code> tag
                            needs to change to
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>&lt;base href="/fe-guild-2019-pwa/"&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Changing the <code>base</code> tag will break our app locally. To fix that rename the
                            <code>public</code> folder to <code>fe-guild-2019-pwa</code>. Stop and restart the
                            app, and we can access it now on <code>localhost:8080/fe-guild-2019-pwa/</code>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To easily deploy to <code>GitHub Pages</code> install the <code>gh-pages</code> node
                            package:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>$ npm install gh-pages --save-dev</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Add a new script to <code>package.json</code>
                        <pre><code>"deploy": "gh-pages -d fe-guild-2019-pwa"</code></pre>
                        and run
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>$ npm run deploy</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            First deployment will take longer because will create a new branch <code>gh-pages</code> and
                            will activate <code>GitHub Pages</code> on this new branch.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take a few minutes (max 5) break and try
                        <pre><code>https://[YOUR GITHUB PROFILE].github.io/fe-guild-2019-pwa/</code></pre>
                        You can now access the application from your phone, and if you have an Android phone you will
                        also get an <code>App Install Banner</code> <em>(Try to group around a colleague that has one to
                        see it in action)</em>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Cancelling the prompt</h3>

                <p>
                    If for some reason you’d prefer not to show the Add to Home Screen banner, you can
                    cancel it completely, as shown in the next listing. Depending on which type of web
                    app you have, it may not make sense to show this prompt. Perhaps your site covers sensitive
                    topics or a short-lived event for which the banner might be more annoying to
                    the user than helpful.
                </p>

                <pre>
<code>
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    return false;
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The code in the listing above will listen for the <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event and prevent
                    the default behavior of the banner if it’s fired. The code is straightforward and uses the standard
                    JavaScript <code>preventDefault()</code> function to cancel the event and returns a false value—both
                    of which are needed to ensure that the banner doesn't appear.
                </p>

                <h3>Determining usage</h3>

                <p>
                    The Add to Home Screen functionality can be helpful for your users, but it’s important
                    to find out if it would be or not. Are your users annoyed by the banner and dismiss
                    it when it appears? Do they trust your application enough to add it to their device?
                </p>

                <p>
                    By listening for the <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event, you can determine whether a
                    user decided to add your web app to their home screen or if they dismissed it. The following
                    listing shows how.
                </p>

                <pre>
<code>
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', event => {
    // Determine the user's choice - returned as a Promise
    event.userChoice.then(result => {
        console.log(result.outcome);

        // Based on the user's choice, decide how to proceed
        if(result.outcome == 'dismissed') {
            // Send to analytics
        } else {
            // Send to analytics
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    At this point, you could decide to send this information to your Web Analytics tools
                    to track the usage of this functionality over time. This technique can be a useful
                    approach for understanding how your users interact with your Add to Home Screen
                    prompt.
                </p>

                <h3>Deferring the prompt</h3>

                <p>
                    Using a combination of the code in listings above, you can defer the <code>Add to Home Screen
                    banner</code> to appear until a later time—for example, if a user visits a site and has met the
                    criteria for the banner to be shown, but you’d prefer them to add your site by allowing them to tap
                    a custom button on your site instead. This puts the user in control of whether or not they’d like
                    to add your site, instead of the browser choosing when it should show the banner.
                </p>

                <p>In <code>src/js/app.js</code></p>

                <pre>
<code>
let deferredPrompt;

window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', event => {
    // Prevent Chrome 67 and earlier from automatically showing the prompt
    event.preventDefault();

    console.log('beforeinstallprompt fired');

    // Stash the event so it can be triggered later.
    deferredPrompt = event;

    return false;
});
</code></pre>
                <p>In <code>src/js/feed.js</code> change the <code>openCreatePostModal</code> function</p>

                <pre>
<code>
const openCreatePostModal = () => {
    createPostArea.style.transform = 'translateY(0)';

    if(deferredPrompt) {
        deferredPrompt.prompt();

        // Determine the user's choice - returned as a Promise
        deferredPrompt.userChoice.then(result => {
            console.log(result.outcome);

            // Based on the user's choice, decide how to proceed
            if (result.outcome === 'dismissed') {
                // Send to analytics
                console.log('User cancelled installation');
            } else {
                // Send to analytics
                console.log('User added to home screen');
            }
        });

        deferredPrompt = null;
    }
};
</code></pre>
                <p>Clicking the <code>FAB</code> button in the lower right corner will produce</p>

            <google-codelab-step label="Service Worker Caching" duration="30">
                <p>
                    Imagine you’re on a train using your mobile phone to browse your favorite website. Every time the
                    train enters an area with an unreliable network, the website takes ages to load—an all-too-familiar
                    scene. This is where Service Worker caching comes to the rescue. Caching ensures that your website
                    loads as efficiently as possible for repeat visitors.
                </p>

                <h2>The basics of HTTP caching</h2>

                <p>
                    Modern browsers can interpret and understand a variety of HTTP requests and responses and are
                    capable of storing and caching data until it’s needed. After the data has expired, it will go and
                    fetch the updated version. This ensures that web pages load faster and use less bandwidth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A web server can take advantage of the browser’s ability to cache data and use it to improve the
                    repeat request load time. If the user visits the same page twice within one session, there’s often
                    no need to serve them a fresh version of the resources if the data hasn't changed. This way, a web
                    server can use the Expires header to notify the web client that it can use the current copy of a
                    resource until the specified “Expiry date.” In turn, the browser can cache this resource and only
                    check again for a new version when it reaches the expiry date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTTP caching is a fantastic way to improve the performance of your website, but it isn’t without
                    flaws. Using HTTP caching means that you’re relying on the server to tell you when to cache a
                    resource and when it expires. If you have content that has dependencies, any updates can cause the
                    expiry dates sent by the server to easily become out of sync and affect your site.
                </p>

                <h2>The basics of caching Service Worker caching</h2>

                <p>
                    You may be wondering why you even need Service Worker caching if you have HTTP caching. How is
                    Service Worker caching different? Well, instead of the server telling the browser how long to cache
                    a resource, you are in complete control. Service Worker caching is extremely powerful because it
                    gives you programmatic control over exactly how you cache your resources. As with all Progressive
                    Web App (PWA) features, Service Worker caching is an enhancement to HTTP caching and works
                    hand-in-hand with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The power of Service Workers lies in their ability to intercept HTTP requests. In this step,
                    we’ll use this ability to intercept HTTP requests and responses to provide users with a lightning
                    fast response directly from cache.
                </p>

                <h3>Precaching during Service Worker installation</h3>

                <p>
                    Using Service Workers, you can tap into any incoming HTTP requests and decide exactly how you want
                    to respond. In your Service Worker, you can write logic to decide what resources you’d like to
                    cache, what conditions need to be met, and how long to cache a resource for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the user visits the website for the first time, the Service Worker begins downloading and
                    installing itself. During the installation stage, you can tap into this event and prime the cache
                    with all the critical assets for the web app.

            .then(() => {
                console.log('[ServiceWorker] Skip waiting on install');
                return self.skipWaiting();
            })
    );
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The code above taps into the install event and adds a list of files <code>URLS_TO_PRECACHE</code>
                    during this stage. It also references a variable called <code>CACHE_STATIC_NAME</code>. This is a
                    string value that I’ve set to name the cache. You can name each cache differently and you can even
                    have multiple different copies of the cache because each new string makes it unique. This will come
                    in handy later in the step when we look at versioning and cache busting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can see that once the cache has been opened, you can then begin to add resources into it. Next
                    you call <code>cache.addAll()</code> and pass in your array of files. The
                    <code>event.waitUntil()</code>
                    method uses a JavaScript promise to know how long installation takes and whether it succeeded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Important to return the promise here to have <code>skipWaiting()</code> fire after the cache has
                    been updated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If all the files are successfully cached, the Service Worker will be installed. If any of the files
                    fails to download, the <code>install</code> step will fail. This is important because it means you
                    need to rely on all the assets being present on the server and you need to be careful with the
                    list of files that you decide to cache in the install step. Defining a long list of files will
                    increase the chances that one file may fail to cache, leading to your Service Worker not being
                    installed.

                        This was the case with our material design CSS file
                        <strong>material.indigo-deep_orange.min.css</strong>.
                        It was served from a CDN that doesn't provide CORS headers. In this case I've chosen to download
                        it and serve it from the <code>lib</code> folder instead.

                <p>
                    If you check now in Chrome Developer Tools you will see that the cache is filled with the static
                    files
                    from the <code>URLS_TO_PRECACHE</code> array:
                </p>

                    <img src="[[rootPath]]images/labs/service-workers/sw-static-cache.png">
                </p>

                <p>
                    But if you look in the <code>Network</code> tab (even after refresh) the files are still fetched
                    over
                    the network:

                <p>
                    The reason is that the cache is primed and ready to go, but we are not reading assets from it.
                    In order to do that we need to add the code in the next listing to our Service Worker in order to
                    start listening to the fetch event.
                </p>

    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request)

                if (response) {

                    return response;

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    We are checking if the incoming URL matches anything that might exist in our current cache using
                    the <code>caches.match()</code> function. If it does, return that cached resource, but if the
                    resource doesn't exist in cache, continue as normal and fetch the requested resource.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the Service Worker installs and activates refresh the page and check again the
                    <code>Network</code>
                    tab. The Service Worker will now intercept the HTTP request and load the appropriate resources
                    instantly from cache instead of making a network request to the server.

                <h3>Intercept and cache</h3>

                <p>
                    So far we cached important resources during the installation of a Service Worker, which is known as
                    precaching. This works well when you know exactly the resources that you want to cache, but what
                    about resources that might be dynamic or that you might not know about? For example, our website
                    might be a sports news website that needs constant updating during a match; we won’t know about
                    those files during Service Worker installation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because Service Workers can intercept HTTP requests, this is the perfect opportunity to make the
                    HTTP request and then store the response in cache. This means that we will request the resource
                    and then cache it immediately. That way, as the next HTTP request is made for the same resource,
                    we can instantly fetch it out of the Service Worker cache.
                </p>

                <p>In <code>sw.js</code></p>

                <pre>
<code>
// Add a new cache for dynamic content
const CACHE_DYNAMIC_NAME = 'dynamic';

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    console.log('[Service Worker] Fetching something ....', event);

    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request)
            .then(response => {
                if (response) {
                    console.log(response);
                    return response;
                }

                // Clone the request - a request is a stream and can be only consumed once
                const requestToCache = event.request.clone();

                // Try to make the original HTTP request as intended
                return fetch(requestToCache)
                    .then(response => {
                        // If request fails or server responds with an error code, return that error immediately
                        if (!response || response.status !== 200) {
                            return response;
                        }

                        // Again clone the response because you need to add it into the cache and because it's used
                        // for the final return response
                        const responseToCache = response.clone();

                        caches.open(CACHE_DYNAMIC_NAME)
                            .then(cache => {
                                cache.put(requestToCache, responseToCache);
                            });

                        return response;
                    })
            })
            .catch(error => console.log('[Service Worker] Dynamic cache error.', error))
    );
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The code above caches the resource fetched from the network and returns it back to the page. If we
                    reload the page the resources cached in both caches will be matched.
                </p>

                <h3>Cache versioning</h3>

                <p>
                    There will be a point in time where the Service Worker cache will need updating. If we make changes
                    to the web application, when need to be sure users receive the newer version of files instead of
                    older versions. As you can imagine, serving older files by mistake would cause havoc on a site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The great thing about Service Workers is that each time we make any changes to the Service Worker
                    file itself, it automatically triggers the Service Worker update flow. In step 3, we looked at
                    the Service Worker lifecycle. Remember that when a user navigates to the site, the browser tries
                    to re-download the Service Worker in the background. If there’s even a byte’s difference in the
                    Service Worker file compared to what it currently has, it considers it new.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This useful functionality gives you the perfect opportunity to update your cache with new files. The
                    best things to change are the <code>cache</code> names by adding a version to them. But if we update
                    cache name, this would automatically create a new cache and start serving your files from that
                    cache.
                    The original cache would be orphaned and no longer used, and we need to delete it. The best place to
                    delete after the old Service Worker is the <code>activate</code> event.
                </p>

                <p>In <code>sw.js</code> first add <code>_v1</code> to both cache names:</p>

                <pre>
<code>
const CACHE_STATIC_NAME = 'static_v1';
const CACHE_DYNAMIC_NAME = 'dynamic_v1';
</code></pre>
                <p>Then adapt the <code>activate</code> callback:</p>

                <pre>
<code>
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
    console.log('[Service Worker] Activating Service Worker ...', event);

    event.waitUntil(
        caches.keys()
            .then(cacheNames => {
                return Promise.all(cacheNames.map(cacheName => {
                    if (cacheName !== CACHE_STATIC_NAME && cacheName !== CACHE_DYNAMIC_NAME) {
                        console.log('[Service Worker] Removing old cache.', cacheName);
                        return caches.delete(cacheName);
                    }
                }));
            })
            .then(() => {
                console.log('[ServiceWorker] Claiming clients');
                return self.clients.claim();
            })
    );
});
</code></pre>

                <h2>Custom <code>Offline page</code></h2>

                <p>
                    Even if we cache the <code>help</code> page when we navigate to it we may happen to become offline
                    before it gets cached, and in this case we get the browser's default offline page. To account for
                    this case we can create our own <code>offline.html</code> page:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Duplicate the <code>index.html</code> file and name the duplicate <code>offline.html</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Replace the <code>main</code> tag with
                        <pre>
<code>
&lt;main class="mdl-layout__content mat-typography"&gt;
  &lt;div class="page-content"&gt;
    &lt;h5 class="text-center mdl-color-text--primary">We're sorry, this page hasn't been cached yet :/&lt;/h5&gt;

                    <li>
                        Add the <code>offline.html</code> to the list of files to be precached.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Increase the version of the <code>static</code> cache.

                    <li>
                        Then inside the <code>fetch</code> handler replace the

                    HTTP caching is a fantastic way to improve the performance of your website, but it isn’t without
                    flaws.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Service Worker caching is extremely powerful because it gives you programmatic control over exactly
                    how you cache your resources. When used hand-in-hand with HTTP caching, you get the best of both
                    worlds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Used correctly, Service Worker caching is a massive performance enhancement and bandwidth saver.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can use a number of different approaches to cache resources, and each of them can be adapted to
                    suit the needs of your users.
